"""Registering the musher plugin with the platform.

A plugin joins the platform by POSTing its manifest to `POST /plugins` (the
platform registry). Musher declares: its name (`musher`), its `base_url`, its
`mcp_path` (`/mcp`), its `health_path` (`/health`), and its SURFACE MAPPING —
for now just `/mcp -> main` (the MCP surface itself is a later item; the
manifest shape is wired now so registration doesn't need to change shape when
it ships).

Registration is BEST-EFFORT and RETRYABLE (hot-pluggable, no platform
restart): `register_with_platform` swallows transport errors and returns
False (logging) so a briefly-down platform can't crash the plugin. The caller
IS a loop: `registration_heartbeat` re-POSTs the manifest every beat for the
app's whole lifespan — the platform's registry is in-memory, so a platform
restart empties it and only a re-assert from this side heals the composed
surfaces. The platform's `POST /plugins` is an idempotent upsert (200 on
re-register); a 409 from an older platform is also treated as success.
