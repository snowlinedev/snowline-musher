"""The musher plugin app — v1 skeleton (spec §8 phase 1).

A FastAPI app that:
  - exposes `/health` (the platform supervisor polls this),
  - REGISTERS with the platform via a lifespan-long registration HEARTBEAT:
    the manifest is POSTed at boot and re-asserted every interval, so a
    platform restart (in-memory registry, boots empty) self-heals within one
    beat instead of requiring this plugin to also be kickstarted. Each beat
    is best-effort, so a briefly-down platform doesn't crash the plugin.

Musher has its OWN database; like the house plugin convention it boot-
migrates to the latest Alembic head in the lifespan, so a schema change
deploys on a plain restart. There is no schema yet (no Run table — a later
item); the migration chain is baselined empty so it exists.

This is scaffold-only: no REST /runs endpoints, no MCP surface, no run engine.
Those are separate follow-up items (spec §8 phases 2-3). `MUSHER_ENABLED`
(off by default, spec §3/§6) gates that future engine; nothing in this phase
does anything gated by it yet beyond existing as a config knob.
