"""Alembic wiring — the migration chain has exactly one head.

Uses `ScriptDirectory` directly (no DB connection needed) so this test runs
without a live Postgres, per the house convention. A DB-backed `migrated_db`
fixture (see conftest.py) additionally exercises `alembic upgrade head`
against a real database when Postgres is reachable, skipping cleanly when it
is not.
